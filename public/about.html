<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Rohan Ekbote, a third-year Information Technology (IT) engineering student at D.Y Patil College of Engineering, Akurdi.
   I'm a passionate web developer, and I'd like to tell you a bit about myself and why I love web development </p>

<p>So, what is web development? Well, it's like building the digital homes and stores you visit on the internet.
   Think of it as constructing a website, just like an architect designs and builds a house.
  Web developers like me work on creating the structure, design, and functionality of these websites, making them look good and work smoothly for people like you who use them.</p>

<p>My passion for web development is not just about coding and designing websites; it's also about making the online world a better place, one website at a time.
   I enjoy the feeling of accomplishment when I see my work live on the internet, accessible to people all around the world.
   In a nutshell, I'm Rohan, a web developer, and I'm passionate about building the digital spaces where people can connect, learn, shop, and share their ideas.
  It's like being a digital architect and artist, and I absolutely love what I do!</p>
